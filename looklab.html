        <div class="cap">Remember Beanie Babies or fidget spinners? <i>Everyone wanted one</i>, until no one did.</div>
        <p>In fashion, trends can fade <span class="animate-highlight">within a few seasons</span>. For independent retailers, one wrong bet can lead to clothes <span class="animate-highlight">no one wants</span> and money they can’t get back. With limited time and resources for trend evaluation, they rely on <span class="animate-highlight">gut instinct</span> for buying decisions, which can lead to unsold inventory, lost capital, and weakened brand loyalty.</p>

    <h3  id="solution">Solution</h3>
            <p>
              We designed a trend analysis platform that unites cultural context, social influences, and product recommendations in one place, helping retailers save time and make informed, brand-aligned decisions with confidence.

        <p>
          I conducted literature reviews and competitive analysis independently, while collaborating on interviews and usability testing with my team. <span class="animate-highlight">I led the complete design of the trends feature from concept to high-fidelity prototype</span> and continued iterating on the design after the official project timeline ended.

        <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
        <h3>interivews, competitive analysis, & literature review</h3>
        <div class="cap">Did you know skirt lengths often mirror the economy?</div>
        <p>The Hemline Index suggests skirts rise in economic booms and fall in downturns, showing that <span class="animate-highlight">fashion trends mirror broader cultural, political, and economic shifts.</p></span>
        <p>To understand how retailers navigate these ever-changing forces, I conducted interviews with six independent boutique owners, complemented by a literature review and competitive analysis. My goal was to learn how small retailers <span class="animate-highlight">evaluate trends and maintain brand authenticity</span> in a fast-moving fashion landscape.</p>
        <p>What I found is that retailers are <span class="animate-highlight">cautious trend adopters.</span> They selectively incorporate elements that align with their identity, balancing cultural awareness with authenticity.</p>
         <img src="/looklabimg/trend adoption.avif" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" alt="How a streetwear retailer may adopt a trend."/>

        <p>Yet, while trends clearly respond to the cultural zeitgeist—shaped by economics, politics, and social movements—<span class="animate-highlight">trend forecasting rarely relies on data.</span> Instead, it draws from emotion, cultural storytelling, and visual imagery, often pulled from runway collections. Existing tools like WGSN capture this through detailed cultural analysis but remain inaccessible to small retailers due to exorbitant costs (~$80,000/yr).</p>
        <img src="/looklabimg/secondaryresearch.avif" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" alt="Secondary research: competitive analysis and lit review."/>

        <p>These findings revealed an opportunity for a visually led, culturally contextual, and more accessible way to evaluate trends—one that empowers retailers to make confident, brand-aligned buying decisions without sacrificing time or identity.</p>

        <h2 id="design">Design</h2>
        <h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
        <p>After synthesizing the research, we brainstormed potential approaches for the trends feature</p>
        <img src="/looklabimg/trends_brainstorm.avif" loading="lazy" alt="Mindmap of brainstormed ideas" />
        <p>and landed on 4 concepts.</p>
        <!-- <div class="full-bleed"> -->
        <img src="/looklabimg/conceptexploration.avif" loading="lazy" alt="Mindmap of brainstormed ideas" />



        <h3 id="conceptselection">Concept Selection</h3>
        <p>Our client was drawn to concept 2 for its editorial quality and visual storytelling, likening it to exploring a fashion magazine rather than a standard interface. The team chose this direction because it captures the <span class="animate-highlight">cultural systems that drive fashion trends,</span> aligning with our goal to make trend evaluation both insightful and visually engaging</p>
        <h4>Design Rationale</h4>
          <p>Retailers reference multiple sources but lack time to synthesize them. The Modal Map brings core trend elements—color, fabric, style, cultural influences, and origins—into a single interface and visualizes their relationships. This structure emphasizes influential elements, helping retailers allocate <span class="animate-highlight">limited time and budgets towards high-impact opportunities.</span></p>

          <h4>Design Trade-offs</h4>
          <div class="cap">"Look into other industries and what’s going on in the world. Politics, AI, sustainability, real estate…they all contribute to the fashion scene.”</div>
           <p>The nodal interface condenses trends into a single view. It can feel overwhelming at first, but fashion itself is <span class="animate-highlight">interconnected:</span> cultural movements influence fabrics, economic shifts shape colors, and these relationships define brand fit. Separating these elements would make navigation easier but limit understanding. <span class="animate-highlight">Retailers need to see how each component connects to adapt trends selectively,</span> understanding not just what’s trending but why and how it fits their identity.

      <h3 id="usabilitytesting">Usability Testing</h3>
      <p>We conducted moderated usability sessions with six participants (four boutique owners, two corporate buyers) to assess clarity, credibility, and usefulness. Each task was tied to a design objective to evaluate how well the solution met user needs.</p>

      <h3 id="results">Usability Testing Results</h3>
      <p>Testing yielded mixed feedback with helpfulness at 3.6/5 and trustworthiness at 3.2/5.</p>

      <div class="cap">"My first question would be <i>how are you getting the data for it?</i> "</div>

      <p><span class="animate-highlight">Missing data sources reduced user trust.</span> I initially omitted citations, assuming users would trust the platform to manage data validity behind the scenes. Feedback revealed that transparency is essential for building trust, especially when decisions carry financial risk. I addressed this by adding references from established fashion magazines and using logos for instant source recognition. For retailers making high-stakes purchases, <span class="animate-highlight">credible sourcing strengthens confidence.</span></p>

      <img src="/looklabimg/iteration1.avif" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="800" alt="First iteration: incorporating sources"/></section>

      <h3 id="discovery">Enhancing Discovery</h3>
      <div class="cap">"<i>It doesn't have a lot of depth.</i> It looks great in that little pop-up box, but I think it could be a little bit more informed both in information and also in sources."</div>
      <p>Testing revealed that <span class="animate-highlight">users wanted more product recommendations and contextual information</span> to understand how trends translate into actual store implementation. I addressed this through expanding the contextual information, adding runway images, and including more product recommendations per trend element. This will give retailers clearer use cases and a faster path from trend discovery to sourcing and merchandise planning.</p>

      <h3 id="reduce">Reducing Cognitive Load</h3>
      <div class="cap">"I wonder if this [nodal map] is a <i>barrier that distracts from learning.</i> "</div>

      <p>I realized my attempt to reduce reading time by showing everything at once was actually <span class="animate-highlight">overwhelming users.</span> Two issues drove this: visual clutter from node images and weak hover states that didn't clearly guide attention. I removed the images and strengthened the hover/focus states by dimming non-active nodes, <span class="animate-highlight">directing users' focus to one element at a time.</span></p>

      </section>

      <h3 id="shortcuts">Providing Shortcuts</h3>
      <div class="cap">"<i>I do not care about the historical context,</i> I only want to see the clothes."</div>

      <p>User feedback revealed <span class="animate-highlight">different information priorities</span>: some participants immediately looked for product recommendations while others wanted to explore cultural context first. During testing, I noticed users scanning the interface for quick access to sourcing information. I redesigned the interface to provide a <span class="animate-highlight">direct shortcut to product recommendations for efficiency-focused users, while preserving rich contextual content for those seeking deeper trend analysis.</span></p>

      </section>

      <h3 id="popups">Eliminating Popups</h3>
      <p>The previous design required users to close popups each time they explored a node, creating a <span class="animate-highlight">repetitive interaction friction.</span> I removed popups entirely and <span class="animate-highlight">embedded the content directly into the main interface,</span> freeing up space and eliminating interruptions. This reduces both physical and cognitive effort, allowing users to navigate between nodes seamlessly without breaking their research flow.</p>

       <h3>Validating the Core Concept</h3>
       <p>Testing confirmed that visualizing trend relationships met a real user need. Boutique owners said the nodes “act like a snapshot of the trend,” suggesting greater confidence in purchasing decisions.</p>
       <h3>Identifying and Addressing Key Usability Barriers</h3>
       <p>Early testing revealed trust and cognitive load issues (trustworthiness 3.2/5). I refined source transparency, hierarchy, and interactions to reduce complexity and guide focus. Follow-up testing would validate improvements in user confidence.</p>
       <h3>Defining Future Success Metrics</h3>
       <p>If launched, success would be measured by a 50% reduction in research time, higher user confidence, stronger adoption and retention, and fewer unsold items through improved trend evaluation.</p>
       </section>
      <section class="next-steps">
      <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
       <h3>Trend Lifecycle Prediction</h3>
       <p>I plan to integrate sales data and machine learning for trend prediction. Since this requires data expertise we don’t yet have, my next step is researching accessible APIs and defining which metrics can be tracked without a data science team.</p>
       <h3>Direct Product Sourcing</h3>
       <p>I’d like to let users view a runway look and instantly access that exact product within the platform to connect inspiration directly to sourcing.</p>
       <h3>Validate spotlight</h3>
       <p>I’ll run usability tests focused on the gradient hover effect to see whether it supports or hinders task completion, and to ensure accessibility for users with visual sensitivities.</p>

      <section class="reflection">
      <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
      <p>This was my first 0→1 project, and it taught me how much scope and timing shape outcomes. We tried to meet every client goal at once, which stretched our capacity. Looking back, earlier testing and smaller iterations would have given us clarity sooner. Next time, I’ll focus on scope and faster prototyping in order to validate concepts earlier in the process.</p>
